LockMusic\
\
== Description ==\
LockMusic is a new iOS 10 compatible tweak that aims to bring functionality alongside with a nice and clean design for your lockscreen music player. \
\
The core idea is based on a publicly shown concept and we plan to expand from there in the next updates.\
\
This is what the tweak currently implements, based on the concept:\
\
	-	Currently playing album image is moved in the central part of the screen\
	-	Track control buttons are moved in the lower part of the screen.\
\
When a notification is received, the layout changes into this:\
\
	-	Currently playing album image is moved in the upper-left part of the screen\
	-	Track control buttons are moved in the upper-right part of the screen.\
\
The notification are still displayed in the central-lower part of the screen. When notifications are removed, the layout transitions back to the initial status.\
\
The next planned updates are right around the corner, and will bring an high degree of customisation to the layout and the player components.\
